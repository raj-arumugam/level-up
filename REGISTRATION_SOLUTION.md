# Registration Issue Solution

## Problem Identified ✅
The registration is failing because the email `rajkumar.arumugam@yahoo.com` **already exists** in the database.

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "User with this email already exists"
}
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use a Different Email Address (Recommended)
Simply try registering with a different email address:

**Examples:**
- `rajkumar.arumugam+test@yahoo.com`
- `rajkumar.test@yahoo.com`
- `your.name+portfolio@gmail.com`

### Option 2: Clear the Database (Development Only)
If you want to reuse the same email, you can clear the users table:

```bash
# Connect to the database and clear users
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U portfolio_user -d portfolio_tracker -c "DELETE FROM users WHERE email = 'rajkumar.arumugam@yahoo.com';"
```

### Option 3: Login Instead of Register
Since the email already exists, you can try logging in with the existing account:

**Login Credentials:**
- Email: `rajkumar.arumugam@yahoo.com`
- Password: The password you used when you first registered

## Password Validation ✅
Your password `Test@123` meets all requirements:
- ✅ 8 characters long
- ✅ Has lowercase letter (e, s, t)
- ✅ Has uppercase letter (T)
- ✅ Has number (1, 2, 3)
- ✅ Has special character (@)

## Test Results ✅
Registration works perfectly with a new email:

```bash
# This worked successfully:
curl 'http://localhost:3001/api/auth/register' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Origin: http://localhost:3000' \
  --data-raw '{"email":"rajkumar.new@yahoo.com","password":"Test@123","firstName":"Rajkumar","lastName":"Arumugam"}'

# Response: HTTP 201 Created - User registered successfully
```

## Application Status
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 ✅
- **Backend**: http://localhost:3001/api/ ✅
- **Registration API**: Working correctly ✅
- **CORS**: Fixed ✅
- **Rate Limiting**: Fixed ✅

## Next Steps
1. **Try a different email address** in the registration form
2. **Or try logging in** with the existing email if you remember the password
3. **Or clear the database** if this is for development testing

The registration system is working perfectly - the only issue is the duplicate email constraint (which is working as intended for security).
